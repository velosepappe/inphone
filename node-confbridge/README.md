# About

This is a basic configuration for a Conference Bridge Application using ARI and
Node.js.

# Installation

## Node.js

This application requires Node.js 0.10.X.

## Install confbridge application
```bash
$git clone https://github.com/semidy/node-confbridge-js.git
$npm install
```

## Install Postgres database driver
```bash
$npm install pg
```

## Create and configure your database

Once you have created and configured your database, you will want to modify
the dbConnection in the config.json to point to your database. For example:
```json
postgres://user:secret@localhost/user
```

## Create or reset to default data

Run the following commands to create and/or reset all default tables, indexes,
user profile, group profile, and bridge profile settings:
```bash
$cd scripts
$node defaultdatabase.js
```

## Adding new data

After you have created and configured your specific database and run the
defaultdatabase.js script, you are now able to setup your own specific user,
group, and bridge profiles, within the scripts folder, that are to be added to the
database.

Run the following commands to add a new user to the database:
```bash
$node adduser.js
```
Run the following commands to add a new group to the database:
```bash
$node addgroup.js
```
Run the following commands to add a new bridge to the database:
```bash
$node addbridge.js
```

## Asterisk configuration

Modify the ariConnection in the config.json to point to your Asterisk Instance.

Add the following to your dialplan to test the default connection:
```bash
exten => 8888,1,NoOp()
        same => n,Stasis(confbridge)
        same => n,Hangup()
```
Also you can add the name of your user_type and group_type in the stasis
application if you have changed it from default. For example:
```bash
exten => 9999,1,NoOp()
        same => n,Stasis(confbridge, usertypename, grouptypename)
        same => n,Hangup()
```
